Ocean tides are caused by the rotation of the Earth and the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun acting on ocean water.
<br>
Water can move up narrow tubes against the force of gravity in what is known as capillary action. 

<br>The brain uses over a quarter of the oxygen used by the human body.

<br>Most of the dust in your home is actually dead skin! Yuck!

<br>Humans get a little taller in space because there is no gravity pulling down on them.

<br>Chemists study various chemical elements and compounds, their properties and how they work together in our bodies and the world around us.

<br>Modern society relies heavily on the convenience and versatility of electricity. It powers your microwave, helps light your house, lets you watch TV and so much more.

<br>Your heart beats around 100000 times a day, 36500000 times a year and over a billion times if you live beyond 30

<br>The left side of your body is controlled by the right side of your brain while the right side of your body is controlled by the left side of your brain.

<br>When traveling at 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour), cars use around half of their fuel just to overcome wind resistance.

<br>The Earth isn't perfectly round, it is slightly flattened at the north and south poles. 

<br>Scientists have the dated the Earth as being between 4 and 5 billion years old!

<br>Approximately 20% of the oxygen in the atmosphere was produced by the Amazon rainforest.

<br>The only elements that are liquid at room temperature are bromine and mercury. However, you can melt gallium by holding a lump in the warmth of your hand.

<br>If you pour a handful of salt into a full glass of water, the water level will actually go down rather than overflowing the glass.

<br>Although oxygen gas is colorless, the liquid and solid forms of oxygen are blue.

<br>There is about 1/2 lb or 250 g of salt (NaCl) in the average adult human body.

<br>Hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will dissolve glass. Although it is corrosive, hydrofluoric acid is considered to be a 'weak acid'.

<br>The hardest chemical in your body is your tooth enamel.

<br>Graphite can be transformed into diamond by applying a temperature of 3000°C and pressure of 100,000 atm.

<br>Each time lightning strikes, some Ozone gas is produced, thus strengthening the Ozone Layer in the Earth's atmosphere.

<br>The only letter not used in the periodic table is J.

<br>The human body contains enough carbon to provide 'lead' (which is really graphite) for about 9,000 pencils.

<br>Approximately 20% of the oxygen in the atmosphere was produced by the Amazon rainforest.

<br>Only 28 grams of the rarest substance on Earth exist. What’s the rarest substance on Earth? Astatine.

<br>Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 Kelvin (−196 °C, −321 °F).

<br>Athletes at the Olympic Games have to be careful how much coffee they drink. The caffeine in coffee is a banned substance because it can enhance performance.

<br>Natural Gas has no odor, rather the smell is added in artificially.

<br>The largest organism in the world is a fungus, the honey mushroom or Armillaria ostoyae

<br>Super fluid helium can climb walls

<br>An iceberg contains significantly more total heat energy than a burning match. The reason is the sheer size of the iceberg. 

<br>Caves breathe. They inhale and exhale great quantities of air when the barometric pressure on the surface changes, and air rushes in or out seeking equilibrium.

<br>When a new queen bee emerges in a hive, she “pipes” (repeatedly sings a G# or A note) to incite her worker bees to fight for her if another queen in the hive needs killing. You can listen to the piping in the youtube clip above. All bees pipe the same note – but Africanized bees pipe more frequently and louder. You can hear another clearer example here. The difference in pitch between the video clip and the sound file is cause by compression and quality of recording devices.

<br>There is a current scientific hypothesis that the sun has a companion which is currently about 1-1.5 light years away. It is believed that it has an elliptical orbit which, every 26 million years, sends matter towards the earth causing mass Extinction events. It was the discovery of these seemingly regular events that gave rise to the hypothesis in the first place. The star is predicted to be most likely a red or brown dwarf and has been named Nemesis or “Death Star”.

<br>Fulgurite is the name for fossilized lightning. They are natural hollow glass tubes formed in quartzose sand, or silica, or soil by lightning strikes and are formed when lightning with a temperature of at least 1,800 degrees Celsius instantaneously melts silica on a conductive surface and fuses grains together. 

<br>When Anders Celsius (1701–1744) created the celsius scale, he invented it upside-down with 0 ? being the boiling point of water and 100 ? being the freezing point. It was reversed in the year of Celsius’ death by Carolus Linnaeus.

<br>When dropped on a very hard, rigid surface, glass balls and steel balls will bounce higher than rubber ones. The reason is that rubber balls deform significantly on impact, flattening onto the surface, and then springing back. In the process of this squashing, some energy is lost.

<br>Sound travels much faster through a steel than it does air: Sound travels at 5100 m/s through steel, 1480 m/s through water and 330 m/s through air.

<br>The cracking sound of a whip is actually a sonic boom – this is because the tip of the whip travels faster than the speed of sound. The whip is the first man made device capable of exceeding the sound barrier.

<br>The world’s first nuclear reactor was built in a squash court beneath a Chicago football stadium on December 2, 1942. While it only generated enough power to light a flashlight, it proved that nuclear power was feasible
