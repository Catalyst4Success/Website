	<h2>The Organization</h2>
	<p>Catalyst for Success, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, was founded in 2012 by Jason Ge, a junior in high school and a silver medalist from Team USA at the International Chemistry Olympiad. All of our activities and programs are planned out and executed by high school students. Our goal is to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) for young students in order to inspire them to become the world's future scientists and innovators.</p>
<h2>Magic Shows</h2>
<p>The first component of our program focuses around a chemistry magic show that consists of many cool demonstrations that present science in a fun and engaging way, not just a "textbook" subject. Since beginning this program in February 2013, we have already reached over 5000 students through our magic shows. In addition, we have scheduled shows through the end of the school year in which we will have reached over 10,000 students from 14 schools in the San Diego Area.</p>
<h2>Hands On Activities</h2>
<p>The magic shows are a wonderful way of getting students interested in science. But we didn't want to stop at interest. We want to provide a way for students to engage with science in a very interactive way. Thats why we also provide hands on activities for students where they get the opportunity to experiment and test out their passion for science. Since starting this component of our program in mid-March, we have reached out to four classrooms and have scheduled for a total of 10 classrooms to be apart of our hands on activities by the end of May.</p>
