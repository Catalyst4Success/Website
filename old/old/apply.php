				<center>Catalyst For Success has really opened my eyes to the potential that the kids we reach have to become something extraordinary. You can see in their eyes as they watch the magic shows and hands-on activities that they're fascinated with what's going on in front of them. Being able to provide so many kids with the wonders of science when most think the subject is boring, full of textbooks and reports, fills me with joy. You feel great, knowing that you're helping to spark the interest of future scientists, who may make life-changing discoveries. I'm extremely fortunate to be able to be part of such an amazing organization as Catalyst.</center>

				<center>The experiences I enjoy most in Catalyst for Success are definitely during the question sessions at the end of every show. It is really inspiring for me to hear all the unique questions the kids ask about different aspects of science after we show them how cool the subject can really be. One questions I especially enjoyed answering was during a show at Torrey Hills Elementary School when a 2nd grader asked why the gas giant planets in space don.t explode even though their atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen gas, which is an extremely flammable material as we showed in one of our experiments.
   The fact that this young student was able to make a connection between our small hydrogen balloon experiment and the gas giants in space was really amazing to me. Every single show that I go to inspires me further to continue spreading my knowledge of science to those who are not getting as much exposure to the subject as I am, Its wonderful to watch the kids fall in love with the magic of science, and this is one of the many reasons I am proud to be a member of Catalyst for Success.</center>

   <center>Catalyst for Success is not simply a club or an organization.  Catalyst is a lifestyle, a place to have fun, a place to meet new people, and, arguably most importantly, an avenue to better the lives of children that could go on to be the next great minds of the world.  Even though being an active member can require a lot of commitment and work, it is made completely worth it once you see the results.  One of the aspects that I enjoy most is the engagement of the kids, something that is hard to see in school on many occasions.  It is hard to beat the feeling of when you are explaining titrations to elementary schoolers and they ask when you will be coming back.</center>
