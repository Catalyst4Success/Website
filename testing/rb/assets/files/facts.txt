The only letter not appearing on the Periodic Table is the letter J.
Glass is actually a liquid, it just flows very, very slowly. Same with asphalt.
In the early 1940s a large portion of the world’s plutonium supply was accidentally ingested by a lab technician. The majority of plutonium, like other heavy metals, passes right through your digestive tract.
Watson and Crick, the co-discoverer’s of the DNA double helix never actually ran any experiments on their own, but rather read deeply into others’ work and deduced the structure.
Lithium can alter how you think and has been known to “cure” certain mental illnesses. In fact, lithium is used in a lot of psychoactive drugs.
One of the first x-rays, a picture you’ve probably seen of a woman’s hand with a ring on it, was of Bertha Rontgen’s hand. She thought seeing her bones was a death omen.
People used to drink radioactive water from a device called the “Revigator.” It was considered to be a healthy drink.
Diamonds aren’t the rarest gems on Earth. In fact, they’re relatively common. The rarest gem is jadeite and costs about $3 million per carat.
Only 28 grams of the rarest substance on Earth exist. What’s the rarest substance on Earth? Astatine.
Mosquitoes like the scent of estrogen, hence, women get bitten by mosquitoes more often than men do.
Natural gas has no odour. The smell is added artificially so that leaks can be detected
If you slowly pour a handful of salt into a totally full glass of water it will not overflow. In fact, the water level will go down.
If the Sun were made of bananas, it would be just as hot
All the matter that makes up the human race could fit in a sugar cube
Light does not always travel through a vacuum. In water, for example, photons travel at around three-quarters that speed.
Incidentally, the slowest light has ever been recorded travelling was 17 meters per second – about 38 miles an hour – through rubidium cooled to almost absolute zero, when it forms a strange state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.
there is a disease that affects the inner ear and amplifies all internal sounds. It gets to the point where the sound of eyeballs moving in their sockets sounds like "sandpaper on wood". Its called the Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome.
There is an ancient arthropod ancestor named Hallucigenia because "nothing about it makes much sense"
There is a species of spider named Calponia harrisonfordi and a species of spider named Pheidole harrisonfordi in honor of the actor's work as a conservationist and environmentalist.
Regular coffee drinkers have a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and other health problems due to an unidentified component interacting with the caffeine.
In 2011, a fungus was found in the Amazon Forest that can feed on a diet solely of polyurethane (plastic). It can also do so in a non-aerobic environment.
Mars' smallest moon, Deimos, has an escape velocity of 5.6 m/s, meaning that if you were to take a running jump while on it, you would launch off like a slow rocket.
The human brain is wired to connect with others so strongly that it experiences what they experience as if its happening to us.
The world's largest virus has a unique genome. 93% of its DNA does not seem to match with the DNA of any other organism. This hints at a fourth domain of life.
In the late Devonian period (during the evolution of terrestrial plants), there was a "wood crisis". Trees became abundant, took CO2 out of the air, and caused an ice age simply because the fungi that eventually would decompose dead wood and return the CO2 to the air hadn't evolved yet.
Scientists have developed a beer that has electrolytes, making it more hydrating and refreshing.
A human brain produces as many as 12,000 to 50,000 thoughts per day, depending on how deep a thinker a person is. Most of the so-called random daily thoughts are about our social environment and ourselves.

Contrary to popular belief, Einstein never failed math in school. In fact, by 15 he had already mastered differential and integral calculus.
The Super Mushrooms used in Mario are based on a fungi named Amanita Muscaria. They make the user feel as though they are growing in size. This effect was also referenced in Alice in Wonderland.
Cats have no naturally occurring antibodies against dogs' blood. So they can receive a dog's blood in life-threatening situations. But only once. The second time proves fatal.
The domesticated dog evolved from a tamer version of the grey wolf. Based on DNA evidence, researchers currently believe the dog was domesticated in Asia at least 15,000 years ago, with some scientists arguing that dogs and humans have been partners for as long as 100,000 years.
Black holes aren’t black. They glow, slightly, giving off light across the whole spectrum, including visible light.
Without E=MC2, GPS would malfunction.
Despite all the advances made in astrophysics in recent years, not least the discovery of various exoplanets beyond our solar system, we don’t know what makes up the majority of the universe.
At ‘normal’ speeds, this mass gain is pretty negligible, but as you approach the speed of light mass begins to increase dramatically.
According to the multiverse theory, there are an infinite number of universes existing parallel to one another, with each differing slightly and every possible scenario being played out in its own universe.
The effect of Relativity made Astronaut Sergei Avdeyev a fraction of a second younger upon his return to Earth after 747 days in space.Submitted by: Moi - CanadaSubmitted by: Moi - Canada
The Dead Sea is so dense with salt, you can easily float on it without drowning.
Lake Baikal in Russia contains more water than all the North American Great Lakes combined.
The world's densest wood, the Black Ironwood (Olea laurifolia), does not float on water and therefore sinks.
The mass of our entire atmosphere is estimated to be some 5.5 quadrillion tons (55 followed by 14 zeros).
Chewing gum was invented by a dentist, named William Semple - as a way to exercise your jaws.
If you stand on the equator, the land beneath you will go up and down by as much as 21 inches (55 centimeters) over the course of a day.
Because of relativity, you head is slightly older than your feet. Because your feet are usually closer to the center of the earth, time moves faster for your feet.
All the gold ever mined from the earth by humans, would comprise a 66 by 66 foot cube. 
The average rocket delivers just 3-5% of its take-off weight to space. Fuel accounts for more than 90% of a rocket’s mass! 
The first freely programmable computer was made by Konrad Zuse in 1938. It is known as the Z1.
On a mountain in Texas, a team of engineers sponsored by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is constructing a clock that will operate on its own for 10,000 years. The clock is being built from reinforced titanium and stainless steel, and it can capture energy from temperature changes.
